Considerations
==============

The following section on Kubernetes deployment for a Corda Node is considered **experimental** and should not be used in a production environment until sufficient testing has been done.

The deployment can be used for setting up test environments and gaining familiarity around orchestrating a deployment of a Corda Node along with a Corda Firewall.

The current version of the Kubernetes deployment only has support for Microsoft Azure cloud service built in, but with some customisation it should be portable to any other cloud environment as well.
