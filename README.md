## GUI Editing Tooling for Mac

A nice visual git browser is (good for non-devs): https://desktop.github.com/
A visual editor that has a wysiwyg editor for markdown is: https://atom.io/ and insall the rst-preview package https://atom.io/packages/rst-preview
Note rst-preview requires you to install pandoc https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases

## Live Editing

This will watch the source and auto build the html and refresh the connected browser when a file is changed:
``
sudo pip install sphinx-autobuild
``

- Try to run sphinx-autobuild - If the command is not found then check the above logs for a warning about the python plugins path not being on the main path
- Edit your PATH variable to include this directory
- Then run:
``
cd solutions
make livehtml
``
