Roles and Responsibilities
--------------------------

Having observed the creation of Corda business networks, we acknowledge the importance of a governing entity.  That governing entity addresses the strategic business and technical needs of the users of the business network's services, but does not address the operational needs.  Similarly, the users of the Corda business network have not yet been considered. Lets start with exploring these key roles while recognizing that they may vary in size, and may also represent an individual, a company,
or a consortium.


Business Network Governor (BNG)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Business Network Governor (BNG) is responsible for defining the strategic management and governance policies of the
business network, and is accountable for the implementation and enforcement of those policies.

- Defines the legal and regulatory basis on which the business network operates.
- Creates the financial model that sustains the network operations and considers its growth.
- Establishes and controls any technical standards associated with the business network's activities.
- Identifies the network assets, their lifecycles, and associated business processes around which CorDapp (and other) software are developed to meet the needs of the business network.
- Determines how the business network will be operated and supported, including membership on-boarding and off-boarding requirements, as well as any dispute management rules and processes.

It is sometimes argued that if we were to build a truly decentralised business network then there is not role for
a BNG, but even the decision to make the network decentralised implies a specific governance decision.  The BNG may
not be readily visible, but does not go away.

Business Network Operator (BNO)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Business Network Operator (BNO) is responsible for the day to day management of the business network.

- Implements and enforces the policies established by the BNG.
- Manages membership of the business network, including performing the on-boarding member vetting process established by BNG.
- Handles marketing, promotion, and any other day to day organisational services, that are required to operate a healthy
  business network.
- Provides, or arranges for, support for problems encountered by the business network's users.
- Provides reporting to the BNG.

It is worth nothing that for some business networks the BNG and BNO role may be fulfilled by the same organisation.

Business Network User (BNU)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A business network user makes use of the services offered by the business network.  There may be many different
types of user, depending on the application.
