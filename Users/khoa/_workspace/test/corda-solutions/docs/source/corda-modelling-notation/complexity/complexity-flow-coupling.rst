Flow Level Coupling
-------------------

This is the loosest form of coupling, there is no coupling at the State Machine level, any coupling is purely done by including the States to be coupled in the same Transaction when assembling the Transaction in the flows.

Note, using Flow Level Coupling does not provide any guarantees of behaviour at the Transaction level.
